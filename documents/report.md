## 5. System Design

### **5.1. System Architecture**

The movie rental application follows a client-server architecture. On the client-side (frontend), the user interface provides an interactive platform where users can browse movies, search and filter based on various criteria, view movie details including trailers and reviews, manage their rental queue, and access personalized recommendations. User authentication ensures secure access to user-specific features and account management. On the server-side (backend), the application server hosts the core business logic, handling user requests, processing data, and generating responses. It utilizes a database management system to store movie data, user profiles, rental history, and other relevant information. APIs enable communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating operations such as retrieving movie data, managing user accounts, processing rental requests, and generating recommendations. Integration with a payment gateway ensures secure payment transactions for renting movies. Content delivery and streaming rely on a content delivery network (CDN) for efficient content distribution and a video streaming infrastructure to encode, store, and deliver movie content in different formats. Digital rights management (DRM) technologies protect copyrighted content and enforce access restrictions. External integrations include fetching movie metadata from providers like TMDB API, integrating with a payment gateway for secure transactions, and utilizing recommendation engines to generate personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history.
